# CommCare Connect Deployment

This folder contains the configuration and scripts for deploying CommCare Connect.

## Overview

CommCare Connect is deployed to AWS using Docker containers. The deployment is managed using [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/), a Ruby-based deployment tool.
See https://semaphoreci.com/blog/mrsk.

Deploying commcare-connect uses the following tools:

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

  - Setup of EC2 instances
  - Management of Docker container ENV files

- [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/)

  - Deployment of Docker containers

- [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/)

  - Some secrets are stored in 1Password and retrieved using the CLI

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  - Used to manage AWS resources

## Setup

### Kamal

(requires Ruby)

```bash
gem install kamal -v '~> 1.9.2'
```

### Ansible

This is only required if you need to update Django settings.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install ansible
```

### 1Password CLI

See https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/

Note: Do not use Flatpack or snap to install 1password CLI as these do not work with the SSH agent.

You will also need to update the 1Password configuration to allow it to access the SSH key:

_~/.config/1Password/ssh/agent.toml_

```toml
[[ssh-keys]]
vault = "Commcare Connect"
```

See https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent for more details.

To test that this is working you can run:

```bash
ssh connect@54.172.148.144
```

#### AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure sso --profile commcare-connect
aws sso login --profile commcare-connect
```

Note: If you used a different profile name you will need to set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to the profile name.

## Updating Django Settings

The Django settings are configured using the `deploy/roles/connect/templates/docker.env.j2` file. The plain text
settings values are in the `deploy/roles/connect/vars/main.yml` file. Secrets are stored in the 1Password under the
`Ansible Secrets` entry.

To update the Django settings:

```bash
inv django-settings
```

## Deploy

Ideally deploy should be done via GitHub actions however it can be run locally as follows:

```bash
inv deploy
```

## Accessing logs

The logs from the Docker containers are shipped to CloudWatch. To access them you will need to use the AWS console.

You can also view them using Kamal:

```bash
kamal app logs
```

See `kamal app logs --help` for more details.
